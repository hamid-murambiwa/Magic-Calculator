        In turn, an online calculator has a different purpose: it is an interactive
        software tool that is designed to process a predefined set of mathematical
        functions in order to simulate a business process.
        <br />
        Like all other electronic devices, calculators work by processing information
        in binary form. Thus, when you input numbers into a calculator, the integrated
        circuit converts those numbers to binary strings of 0s and 1s.
        <br />
        Online calculators can be used to process orders and payments, simplify part of your sales
        work, and reduce the time you spend interacting with customers.
